## APIs Used

Two APIs were integrated into the game for additional functionality:

1. [**Dictionary API**](https://rapidapi.com/twinword/api/word-dictionary/?utm_source=ANIA-KUBOW&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel): This API allows the game to perform dictionary lookups to validate words. It ensures that players only guess valid words. The API used for this purpose is from RapidAPI.

2. [**Five-Letter Word Generator API**](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/random-word-by-api-ninjas/): This API generates a random five-letter word for the player to guess. It provides a new word for each game session. The API used for this purpose is from RapidAPI.

## How to Run the Game

   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key` with the actual API key obtained from RapidAPI.
